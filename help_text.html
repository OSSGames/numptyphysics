<H1>What To Do?</H1>
Harness gravity with your crayon and set about creating blocks, ramps, levers, pulleys and whatever else you fancy to get the little red thing to the little yellow thing.<P>

<H1>Drawing Stuff</H1>
<H2>Strokes</H2>
When you draw on the screen you create strokes. Each stroke is like a rigid piece of wire with a mass proportional to its length. A closed stroke is just a wire bent into a shape, it has no substance apart from its perimeter.
<H2>Joints</H2>
The ends of a stroke can (and will) join onto other strokes when drawn near enough to another stroke. These joints are pivots so you can use this to build levers, pendulums, bicycles and other mechanical wonders. Jointed strokes can swing past each other without colliding. Join both ends to make a rigid structure.
<H2>Different Strokes</H2>
The Tool Menu allows you to create some special types of strokes:<P>
<LI>Ground -- a fixed stroke that does not move.<P>
<LI>Sleepy -- a stroke that does not move until hit by another stroke.<P>
<LI>Decor -- a decorative stroke that does not have a physical presence.<P>
<H2>Cheating</H2>
There's no such thing as cheating - it's all in your head.  Sometimes it's handy to pause the physics when making something complicated.  This is by no means necessary but try making a bicycle with live physics.  However it is commonly held that changing the pen colour and drawing a red thing right on top of the yellow thing is almost certainly a cheat's solution.<P>
<H1>Controls</H1>
Basic drawing is with finger or stylus.<P>
Undo by tapping the proximity sensor or one of the undo Shortcut keys.<P>
